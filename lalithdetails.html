    <h1>Home Lalitha Mahal Palace</h1>
    <p>Lalitha Mahal Palace in Mysuru was built by the former Maharaja of Mysuru as a residence for his most important guest, The Viceroy of India. Situated on a low hill at the foot of Chamundi Hill, just outside Karnataka's cultural capital Mysuru city, Lalitha Mahal Palace was an opulent residence, vintage building and now a super luxurious heritage hotel.

Lalitha Mahal is an iconic two-storey building coloured in white. Lalitha Mahal features a projecting porch, spherical domes, a large central dome and iconic columns. Interiors are done with immaculately polished marble floors, highly crafted rosewood furniture, majestic staircases, imported carpets, intricate chandeliers and curtains. Stately upper floor offers breathtaking views. Lalitha Mahal will complete a century in 2021. The central hall has life-size portraits of royal family members and artwork that depicts the history of Mysuru.

At present, Lalitha Mahal Palace is a luxury hotel maintained by Jungle Lodges & Resorts. Lalitha Mahal offers 54 stately suites and rooms, including the most luxurious "The Viceroy Suite". The former ballroom has been a gourmet repurposed as restaurant. 'Mysuru Silver Thali' is the most royal and exquisite meal one can have in Mysuru, served on silver cutlery.

Lalitha Mahal palace campus has a swimming pool, tennis jogging track, health club and other facilities. Guests can also access nearby golf courses. A host of support staff in traditional attire ensures a truly royal experience.
