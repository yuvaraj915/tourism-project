    <h1>Jaganmohan Palace</h1>
    <p>Jagan Mohan Palace is one of the magnificent palaces that add to the glory of Mysore's princely monarchy. The palace is a magnificent piece of architecture that reflects the style of Mysore's former rulers, the Wodeyar Kings.
From 1897 to 1912, the exquisite palace housed the royal family of Mysore. Many significant events in Mysore's history have occurred in the palace. Jaganmohan Palace is now an art gallery as well as a function space.</p>
  <h1>History</h1> 
  <p>The Jagan Mohan Palace was built in 1861 as an alternative palace for the royal family by Krishna Raja Wodeyar III, the then-king of Mysore.
The Mysore Palace, which served as the official seat of the Wodeyar Kings, was destroyed in a huge fire in 1897 during Princess Jayalakshmanni's royal wedding.
The royal family utilised the Jagan Mohan Palace as their residence following the destruction of the Mysore Palace.
It served as the royal residence until the Mysore Palace was completely rebuilt in 1912.
During this time, the palace also served as the venue for the king's daily durbars as well as the exceptional Dasara durbars. Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV's coronation took place in the palace pavilion in 1902.
The Mysore University's first convocation ceremonies were held inside the Jagan Mohan Palace. In July 1907, the Mysore Legislative Council conducted its inaugural session in the palace.

<h1>architecture</h1>
<p>The Jaganmohan Palace is a three-story Hindu-style edifice.
In 1900, the original palace was expanded by adding an external frontage and a hall to the existing structure.
