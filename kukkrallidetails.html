        <h1>Kukkralli Lake</h1>
        <p>Kukkarahalli Lake is spread over 58 hectares with a shoreline of roughly five kilometers in Manasagangothri, the sprawling campus of the University of Mysore.</p>
        <p>Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar was responsible for getting the lake created, in the year 1864, to provide water for irrigation to about 10,000 acres of land outside the city. Reckoned to be a jewel in the crown of Mysore, the picturesque lake, which inspired poet laureate Kuvempu to pen many of his works, provides the much-needed lung-space to the city.
</p>
<p>This lake is home to more than 180 species of birds, some of them aquatic. During the migratory season the lake plays host to a variety of winged visitors, some from as far as Siberia. The birds found in the lake are Spot-billed Pelicans, Little Cormorant, Painted Storks, Open-bill Storks, Eurasian Spoonbills, Black-crowned Night Herons and Oriental Darters. Bird life International has included Kukkarahalli Lake in the list of 38 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Karnataka.<br>
    The views from the north shore is particularly attractive with the lake and its surrounding trees, the spire of the deputy commissioner's offices rising above them and the low rise of the Chamundi Hill in the background. The 4.5 Kms walking path circumvents the lake with shaded stone benches for visitors to sit, relax and enjoy the scenic serenity of the lake. Kukkarahalli Lake is a popular destination for both morning & evening walkers.
